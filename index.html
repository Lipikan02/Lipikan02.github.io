            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <!-- Hello -->
            <p>Greetings and welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Luc Iñaki Palacios, and I'm delighted to share a glimpse into my journey and passions with you.</p>
            <!-- Education -->
            <p>Currently, I am pursuing my studies in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, with an anticipated graduation year of 2026. However, my educational path has been quite unconventional. As a child, I was homeschooled by my mother, an experience that instilled in me a sense of self-discipline and a thirst for knowledge. When the time came for high school, I opted for community college, which provided me with a diverse learning environment and valuable experiences beyond the traditional classroom setting.</p>
            <!-- Interests -->
            <p>My interests are eclectic and reflect my curiosity about the world around me. From delving into the intricacies of FinTech tointerests exploring the thrill of FPV Drones, my pursuits are diverse and ever-evolving. I'm equally passionate about hitting the soccer field for a game, carving through powder on a snowboard, or engaging in strategic battles in the world of Magic: The Gathering. Each interest offers its own unique challenges and rewards, keeping me engaged and motivated in different ways.</p>
            <!-- Bye -->
            <p>Through this portfolio website, I aim to showcase my projects, achievements, and the unique blend of skills and experiences that define who I am. Thank you for taking the time to learn about me, and I look forward to connecting with you further on this exciting journey.</p>
